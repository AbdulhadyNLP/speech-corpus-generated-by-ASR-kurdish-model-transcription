# AsoSoft Kurdish Speech Corpus

## Overview
The AsoSoft Kurdish Speech Corpus is an extensive collection of transcriptions generated by our ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) model. This corpus encompasses data from over 50 Kurdish channels, meticulously processed and transcribed to support the development of robust Kurdish ASR systems.

## Methodology
The corpus was created through a multi-step process:
1. **Channel Crawling:** Automated scripts crawled over 50 Kurdish channels to identify and list relevant video content.
2. **Playlist Extraction:** Extracted playlists for systematic access to the videos.
3. **Video Download:** Videos were then downloaded in their entirety.
4. **Video Segmentation:** Downloaded videos were segmented into manageable clips suitable for transcription.
5. **Transcription:** Each video clip was fed into our ASR model, which generated the transcriptions.

## Corpus Contents
The corpus includes:
- Transcriptions in Kurdish.
- Metadata for each transcription, including timestamps and source channel information.
